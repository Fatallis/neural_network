# Make a neural network

##Overview

This is a [simple](http://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/Neural/single.neural.html) single layer feedforward neural network (perceptron). We use binary digits as our inputs and expect binary digits as our outputs. We'll use [backpropagation](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) via gradient descent to train our network and make our prediction as accurate as possible.

##Dependencies

None! Just numpy.

##Usage

Run ``python demo.py`` in terminal to see it train, then predict.
